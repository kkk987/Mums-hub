Created By Sherine Mathew, Mark Ying and Jeffrey Dorling

## Description 
### Purpose
Mums-hub is a website that is designed as an informative blog to help pregnant woman navigate through 
pregnancy. 

Pregnancy is one of the most exciting as well as daunting times in a woman's life. Optimising health and wellbeing during pregnancy is essential for the woman; her family’s and her infant’s future and ongoing health. Unfortunately for a number of women, pregnancy can be a stressful period and lead to significant physical and psychological illness. This website is developed to provide information to women with the emotional and physical support they need to endure this process. 

Blogs are created by Tracey Dorling who has a massive 20+ years of experience working as a midwife. A typical pregnancy lasts 40 weeks from the first day of the last menstrual period (LMP) to the birth of the baby. It is divided into three stages, called trimesters: first trimester, second trimester, and third trimester. The fetus undergoes many changes throughout maturation. Tracey has explained what preganancy is all about in a week to week development stage. She has explained clearly what to expect in a particular week, what is normal during that week and what are the options available to better manage pregnancy. Visitors to this website can read blogs and also allows them to register as a user. Once registered, personalised posts are provided. Users can search through a variety of topics that they are interested in. They can also comment on the post and share their experience or ask a question related to the post.

## Planning Methodology with Screenshots
The planning methodology we have implemented is using Trello. We will be delegating job cards and following along with what cards are complete and incomplete. This was considered and agreed to, due to the ability of having clear jobs to complete in an easy process. It was also approved by all members due to the action of being able to see exactly the jobs are taking the largest times and being able to solve these larger problems together while quickly finishing the smaller jobs separately.

## Source Control
We have planned to use Git source control to organise the development of our MERN application. This is due to the synergy with our planning methodology, trello. We are capable of creating feature branches that coincide with job cards on trello making it easier to organise what we have done and are yet to do.
