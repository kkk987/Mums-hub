# Mums-hub
Created By Sherine Mathew, Mark Ying and Jeffrey Dorling

## Description 
### Purpose
Mums-hub is a website that is designed as an informative blog to help pregnant woman navigate through 
pregnancy. 

Pregnancy is one of the most exciting as well as daunting times in a woman's life. Optimising health and wellbeing during pregnancy is essential for the woman; her family’s and her infant’s future and ongoing health. Unfortunately for a number of women, pregnancy can be a stressful period and lead to significant physical and psychological illness. This website is developed to provide information to women with the emotional and physical support they need to endure this process. 

Blogs are created by Ms Tracey Dorling who has a massive 20+ years of experience working as a midwife. A typical pregnancy lasts 40 weeks from the first day of the last menstrual period (LMP) to the birth of the baby. It is divided into three stages, called trimesters: first trimester, second trimester, and third trimester. The fetus undergoes many changes throughout maturation. Tracey has explained what preganancy is all about in a week to week development stage. She has explained clearly what to expect in a particular week, what is normal during that week and what are the options available to better manage pregnancy. Visitors to this website can read blogs and also allows them to register as a user. Once registered, personalised posts are provided. Users can search through a variety of topics that they are interested in. They can also comment on the post and share their experience or ask a question related to the post.

We start the day with daily standup to track our progress and the tasks for the day. If anyone is blocked at any point, we would work together to resolve the problem.  

### Trello
The tool we used to manage the jobs is trello. We will be delegating job cards and following along with what cards are complete and incomplete. This was considered and agreed to during the first team meeting. It was also approved by all members with a better visualization of the job status(like to-do, in-progress etc.), difficulty, estimated time and job priority.

### Source control process
When we move to development stage, we will use github as our main source control platform. And we are following the featture branch workflow where we will derive feature branches from master branch. After the code is complete in each feature branch, the assigned team member is then required to raise pull requests. At least one other team member also reviews the code, approves it and make appropriate merges to the master branch.

When changes are made, the assigned team member makes appropriate changes on trello cards to update the progress.
